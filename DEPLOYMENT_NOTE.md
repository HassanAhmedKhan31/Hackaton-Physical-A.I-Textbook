# Deployment Notes for Judges

**Note on AI Features:**

This static deployment allows you to read the full textbook content. 

However, the **Interactive AI Features** (Chatbot, User Auth, Custom Learning Paths) require our backend servers (Python/FastAPI & Node/Hono) which are designed to run locally for this prototype.

**For the full experience, please watch our Demo Video** which showcases:
1.  **Auth & Personalization:** How the book changes content based on the "Software" vs "Hardware" engineer role.
2.  **RAG Chatbot:** Real-time Q&A with the textbook content using Vector Search.
3.  **Real-time Translation:** On-the-fly translation of technical concepts to Urdu.

Thank you for reviewing **Physical AI Textbook**!
